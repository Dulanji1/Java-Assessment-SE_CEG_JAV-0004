Objective: Develop a task automation and scheduling system that allows users to automate repetitive tasks and schedule them for execution. The system should focus on modularity, concurrency, and integration with external APIs.

A Task Automation and Scheduling System is a software solution designed to automatically execute repetitive tasks at specified times or intervals without manual intervention. It allows users to define, manage, and schedule tasks, automating workflows and integrating external services to complete those tasks.

Features:
1. User Authentication: Implement secure user login and registration.
2. Task Management: Create, edit, and delete tasks with specific actions.
3. Scheduling: Schedule tasks to run at specified times or intervals.
4. Integration: Connect with external APIs to perform actions (e.g., send emails, fetch data).
5. Notifications: Alert users upon task completion or failure.
   
Technical Requirements:

1. Java 17: Utilize new features and enhancements in Java 17.
2. Spring Boot: Use Spring Boot for building the application.
3. Quartz Scheduler: Implement task scheduling.
4. RESTful APIs: Create APIs for task management and user interactions.
5. Concurrency: Use Java's concurrency utilities for handling multiple tasks.
6. Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL for data persistence.
7. Docker: Containerize the application for easy deployment.
