Objective: Develop a task automation and scheduling system that allows users to automate repetitive tasks and schedule them for execution. The system should focus on modularity, concurrency, and integration with external APIs.

Features:
1. User Authentication: Implement secure user login and registration.
2. Task Management: Create, edit, and delete tasks with specific actions.
3. Scheduling: Schedule tasks to run at specified times or intervals.
4. Integration: Connect with external APIs to perform actions (e.g., send emails, fetch data).
5. Notifications: Alert users upon task completion or failure.
   
Technical Requirements:

• Java 17: Utilize new features and enhancements in Java 17.
• Spring Boot: Use Spring Boot for building the application.
• Quartz Scheduler: Implement task scheduling.
• RESTful APIs: Create APIs for task management and user interactions.
• Concurrency: Use Java's concurrency utilities for handling multiple tasks.
• Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL for data persistence.
• Docker: Containerize the application for easy deployment.
